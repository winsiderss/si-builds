## Reporting a Bug

The System Informer team and community take all security bugs very seriously. We appreciate efforts 
for responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainers at dmex04@gmail.com and johnny.shaw@live.com.

The System Informer team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the System Informer team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary developer. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Seek review from respected third-party security experts.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible.
